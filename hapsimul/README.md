## Constraints

The following constraints are on the BIM file
* alleles cannot be greater than 31k in size (mostly alleles are 1 character long but in some files where long indels are shown  there can be many thousand characters). This should not be a practical limitation. If you do have such a BIM file make a copy and edit it!
* SNP IDs can be no more than 500 characters in length --- also really should not happen in practice.
